// Bakes the macro landform (broad dunes + medium drifts + rock outcrops) into a
// single-channel float texture covering the whole playable field.
//
// Baked rather than evaluated live for one reason: the CPU needs the same
// heights for character grounding, footfall placement and spell hit points, and
// reading back a GPU bake is the only way to guarantee the two never disagree.
// Re-implementing the noise in JS would drift the moment f32 and f64 rounding
// diverged, and the character would float or sink by centimetres.
